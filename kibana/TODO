- Finish the cli to populate from elasticsearch (it is supporting the bigger
  file `/storage/datasets/kibana-presentation/enem-2016.csv`).

- Demonstrate how to create queries and dashboard/graphics on elasticsearch
  (show the "Discover" panel also, with the "pre-analysis" done by it).

## Add the ideas below on potential uses of elasticsearch:

- Make a dump of a postgres table to CSV and load into the cli
  developed on example 2.

- Backup  elasticsearch index (doing some specific query,
  e.g. the last day of data), to a CSV using pandas. It could be easily
restored that way.

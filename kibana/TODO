- Example: Create a general and reusable cli to load the CSVs on
  elasticsearch, using pandas to convert to a json file. If possible, use
panda's batches to control memory consumption.

- Demonstrate how to create queries and dashboard/graphics on elasticsearch
  (show the "Discover" panel also, with the "pre-analysis" done by it).


Colocar essas ideias de potenciais usos do elasticsearch:

- Make a dump of a postgres table to CSV and load into the cli
  developed on example 2.

- Backup  elasticsearch index (doing some specific query,
  e.g. the last day of data), to a CSV using pandas. It could be easily
restored that way.
